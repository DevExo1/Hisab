# Backend API URL (for local development)
# API URL will be determined dynamically based on access method:
# - Via hisab.exolutus.com -> uses https://hisabapi.exolutus.com
# - Via local network -> uses http://10.10.10.120
# Leave empty to use dynamic detection, or set explicitly if needed
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=

# Note: In Docker deployment, API calls are proxied through Nginx
# and the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL is not used in production build
