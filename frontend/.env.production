# Production environment file (not used in Docker build)
# The frontend is built as static files and served by Nginx
# API calls are proxied through Nginx to the backend container

# Note: These values are for local development only
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
# API URL will be determined dynamically based on access method:
# - Via hisab.exolutus.com -> uses https://hisabapi.exolutus.com
# - Via local network -> uses http://10.10.10.120

# For Docker deployment, the Nginx config handles API proxying
# API requests to /api/* are automatically routed to the backend container
